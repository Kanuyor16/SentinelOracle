üìù Description
--------------

I've developed **SentinelOracle**, an Automated Market Sentiment Analyzer smart contract written in **Clarity**. This contract creates a decentralized mechanism for crowdsourcing and aggregating market sentiment, providing a weighted, community-driven prediction. It incentivizes accurate predictions through a staking and reward system and incorporates a **reputation-based weighting system** to prioritize input from historically accurate users. SentinelOracle is designed to operate over discrete time **periods**, tracking individual submissions, calculating an aggregated final sentiment, and rewarding participants whose predictions closely match the eventual "actual outcome" of the period (which is supplied by an authorized oracle/owner).

* * * * *

üèóÔ∏è Core Features
-----------------

-   **Decentralized Submission:** Users can submit their sentiment score (u1 to u100) and an optional confidence level for the current period by staking a minimum amount of microSTX.

-   **Reputation Weighting:** Submissions are weighted by the user's historical accuracy (Reputation Score) and their stated confidence level, ensuring that input from proven predictors carries more influence in the final aggregate.

-   **Period Finalization:** A contract owner (or designated oracle) finalizes each period by providing the "actual outcome" and triggering the calculation of the final aggregated sentiment.

-   **Incentivized Accuracy:** Participants with predictions that meet a high **accuracy threshold** ($\ge 80\%$ difference) are rewarded with their stake back plus a bonus proportional to their accuracy. Inaccurate predictors receive a partial refund (50% of their stake).

-   **Historical Tracking:** The contract tracks sentiment submissions, period aggregates, and individual user reputation over time.

-   **Clarity Smart Contract:** Built on the Stacks blockchain, ensuring transparent, deterministic, and secure execution.

üìú Contract Structure and Logic
-------------------------------

### Data Structures

The contract uses three primary maps to manage state:

| **Map Name** | **Key Structure** | **Value Structure** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sentiment-submissions` | `{user: principal, period: uint}` | `{sentiment-score: uint, confidence: uint, stake-amount: uint, timestamp: uint, claimed: bool}` | Records each user's specific submission for a given period. |
| `user-reputation` | `{user: principal}` | `{total-submissions: uint, accurate-predictions: uint, reputation-score: uint, total-rewards: uint}` | Stores the user's historical performance, crucial for weighting their current submissions. |
| `period-sentiment` | `{period: uint}` | `{total-weighted-sentiment: uint, total-weight: uint, participant-count: uint, finalized: bool, final-sentiment: uint, actual-outcome: uint}` | Aggregates all submissions for a period, storing the calculated community sentiment and the eventual actual outcome. |

* * * * *

### Global Variables

| **Variable Name** | **Type** | **Initial Value** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `current-period` | `uint` | `u1` | The period currently open for submissions. |
| `total-staked` | `uint` | `u0` | Total STX staked across all open periods. |
| `reward-pool` | `uint` | `u0` | Placeholder for a future reward pool (currently rewards are calculated from stake). |
| `period-duration` | `uint` | `u144` | Target duration of a period in Bitcoin blocks (approx. 24 hours). |

* * * * *

### üîí Private Functions (Internal Helpers)

Private functions are internal to the contract and cannot be called directly by external users. They encapsulate core logic, ensuring code reusability and correctness.

#### `(calculate-weighted-score (sentiment uint) (confidence uint) (reputation uint))`

-   **Purpose:** Determines the weight of a user's sentiment submission by factoring in their confidence and historical reputation. This is critical for generating a more reliable aggregate sentiment.

-   Logic: Combines the base weight (sentiment multiplied by confidence) with a reputation bonus calculated from the user's reputation-score.

    $$\text{WeightedScore} = (\text{Sentiment} \times \text{Confidence}) + \left(\frac{\text{Reputation} \times 100}{100}\right)$$

#### `(is-valid-sentiment (score uint))`

-   **Purpose:** Ensures any submitted sentiment score or the `actual-outcome` is within the acceptable boundaries.

-   **Logic:** Returns `true` if the score is $\ge$ `min-sentiment-score` (**u1**) and $\le$ `max-sentiment-score` (**u100**).

#### `(calculate-accuracy (prediction uint) (actual uint))`

-   **Purpose:** Measures how close a user's prediction was to the final actual outcome of the period.

-   Logic: Calculates the absolute difference between the prediction and the actual outcome, then subtracts this difference from 100 to yield a percentage score.

    $$\text{Accuracy} = 100 - |\text{Prediction} - \text{ActualOutcome}|$$

#### `(update-user-reputation (user principal) (is-accurate bool))`

-   **Purpose:** Updates the user's historical performance metrics after a period is claimed.

-   **Logic:** Increments the user's `total-submissions` and conditionally increments `accurate-predictions` if `is-accurate` is true. The `reputation-score` is then updated to reflect the new accuracy percentage.

* * * * *

### Core Public Functions (Entrypoints)

#### `(define-public (submit-sentiment (sentiment uint) (confidence uint)))`

-   **Purpose:** Allows users to record their sentiment and stake collateral.

-   **State Update:** Records the submission in `sentiment-submissions` and updates the aggregate totals in `period-sentiment` using the calculated weighted score. The sender's `min-stake-amount` (u1,000,000 microSTX) is added to `total-staked`.

#### `(define-public (finalize-period (actual-outcome uint)))`

-   **Purpose:** Called by the `contract-owner` to close the current period, record the actual market outcome, and calculate the final aggregated sentiment.

-   **State Update:** Calculates the final sentiment, updates `period-sentiment` with the results, and increments `current-period`.

#### `(define-public (claim-rewards (period uint)))`

-   **Purpose:** Allows a user to claim their stake and any potential rewards for a finalized period.

-   **Reward Logic:** Calculates reward based on accuracy threshold (**u80**). Accurate predictions receive a bonus, while inaccurate ones receive a partial refund. It also calls `(update-user-reputation...)` to update the user's score.

üîÆ Future Enhancements
----------------------

The following features are being considered for future versions:

-   **Dynamic Staking:** Allowing users to stake an amount greater than `min-stake-amount` to increase their base reward potential.

-   **Decentralized Finalization:** Implementing a mechanism (e.g., a simple majority vote or decentralized oracle integration) to allow the community or a set of authorized participants to input the `actual-outcome`, removing reliance on a single `contract-owner`.

-   **Governance Integration:** Allowing STX or project token holders to vote on changes to constants like `min-stake-amount` or `accuracy-threshold`.
